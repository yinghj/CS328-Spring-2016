Final Project for the course Comuputational Model of Cognition

- Investigated literatures modeling conjunction fallacy, representatieness and probabilistic judgements of human in general.

- Implemented the exemplar model to account for the conjunction fallacy and tested it using the Linda Problem (Tversky and Kahneman, 1983)
