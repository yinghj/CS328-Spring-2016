# Modeling the Conjunction Fallacy
## Comuputational Model of Cognition Final Project, Fall 2016

### Rationale: Have you ever heard of the Linda Problem?
- Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.
  - Which of the following two alternatives is more probable?
    1. Linda is a bank teller.
    2. Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement.
- Rationally, statement 2 cannot be more likely than statement 1, but in a 1983 study by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, fully 85 percent of respondents said that it was.

- This is called the conjunction fallacy, a formal fallacy that occurs when it is assumed that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one. (Wikipedia)

### Action Summary:
- Investigated literatures modeling conjunction fallacy, representatieness and probabilistic judgements of human in general.

- Implemented the exemplar model to account for the conjunction fallacy and tested it using the Linda Problem (Tversky and Kahneman, 1983)

- Tested the robustness of the model by adjusting various parameters and assumptions

- Presented the project with an 8-minute presentation and a 7-page final writeup
