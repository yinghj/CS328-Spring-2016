This sounds like an interesting project! You have a good grasp on the literature that's out there, and have identified a problem with interesting cognitive and machine learning implications. For additional information about representativeness, you might try looking at some of the more recent work, such as "Testing a Bayesian Measure of Representativeness Using a Large Image Database" or "Predicting focal colors with a rational model of representativeness". I'm not sure if there's a clear dataset for exactly matching the Linda problem, but if you find a paper that seems like it describes such a dataset, I can help with trying to locate it. In your methods and data analysis, it's important to start narrowing down your scope. I would start off by choosing one model, implement that, and then add additional models. Likely you'll want the first two to be built on somewhat different assumptions or to make different predictions in order to be able to see differences in there behavior (e.g., you might compare representativeness and equate to differentiate, although from your description I still don't completely understand the latter). I'm not quite sure what you mean by wanting to "further train these models". In your data analysis section, you're thinking about good questions for how to evaluate your results.
